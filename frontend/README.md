# TailM8

> Your pet's social network.

TailM8 was created with your furry friends in mind. Our dogs are just like us, they like to play with their friends. Whenever I bring my dogs to the park, I realize they always enjoy playing with a specific few other dogs. When they're not around, they would just sniff around the park or hangout by me. I figured if they rather chill with me at the park, then I could've just stayed home.

I wanted my dogs to have fun too, so I created TailM8, an online network catered to my two dogs, where I can get updates on their pet friends and schedule playdates with 'their' pet friends.

This project will be an ongoing project, with new features to be added and improvements to be made. TailM8 was built with the MERN stack, using Node.js + Express for the backend to allow real-time data connections and modularity. The frontend uses React and Redux, so that I can create reusable components and also take advantage of React's Virtual DOM for efficiency reasons.
